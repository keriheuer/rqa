Unlike linear techniques, recurrence analysis quantifies recurrences in a system's phase space trajectory, rather than the original time series. This approach enables recurrence analysis to describe the underlying dynamics of system without any loss of dynamical information from the observed signal.\n",

To construct the RP, every point in the time series $\\vec{x}(i)$ is compared to subsequent points $\\vec{x}(j)$ and a dot plotted if the difference is less than some threshold $\\varepsilon$. The resulting 2D pattern is a graphical representation of the recurrence matrix, defined as\n",
