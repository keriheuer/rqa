    "The objective of this tutorial is to introduce climate networks and explain and illustrate their application with the __pyunicorn__ package. First some theoretical background for understanding general climate networks will be given and then some methods provided by `pyunicorn.climate.ClimateNetwork` will be illustrated. An introduction and application of coupled climate networks will follow. For a detailed discussion and further references, please consult __[Donges et al., 2015](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4934554)__, on which this tutorial is based. "

    "_Climate networks (CN)_ are a way to apply complex network theory to the climate system, by assuming that each node represents a varying dynamical system. Of interest is then the collective behaviour of these interacting dynamical system and the structure of the resulting network. This approach was first introduced by __[Tsonis and Roebber, 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378437103009646)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Climate network analysis is a versatile approach for investigating climatological data and can be used as a complementary method to classical techniques from multivariate statistics. The approach allows for the analysis of single fields of climatological time series, e.g. surface air temperature observed on a grid, or even two or more fields. It has been succesfully applied in many cases, for example to dynamics and predictability of the El NiÃ±o Phenomenon \\[__[Radebach et al., 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5494)__\\]."
